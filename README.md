# Modeling Multi-way Relations with Hypergraph Embedding
This code is for the paper "Modeling Multi-way Relations with Hypergraph Embedding," which will be presented in CIKM 2018.

There are two directories:

* Train_miss_final: This directory corresponds to Case 1 (Included) in the simulation part.

* Train_nomiss_final: This directory corresponds to Case 2 (Excluded) in the simulation part.

***Usage

* Please download the full directory and leave everything as it is (i.e., do not remove any file from the directory).

* In the directory, execute the program files whose names start with "go", and the experimental results presented in the paper can be obtained.
